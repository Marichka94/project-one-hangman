## List of Features

The game was planned as a stand-alone browser application. The game is created in paper and pencil style, with a library of words provided. In the begining of each game randomly choden word is represented as an arry of dashes. Players try to guess the word by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses. 

Bronze level of the game contained the bare minimum of style and functionality for the letter board and input-sibmit form.

On the Silver (current) level the game was complemented with the picture represantation of life-count. More style was added. The game has one category: animals.

The Gold level still is a work in progress. Some major (literaly life and death) decisions are about to be make. The game are going to have more cattegories. Two players will able to play the game and compete against each other.
